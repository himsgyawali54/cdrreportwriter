                <h2>About Australian Computer Society: ACS</h2>
                <p>
                  The Australian Computer Society (ACS) was formed on January 1,
                  1966, by merging five state-based societies. As an authorized
                  assessing authority, ACS conducts skill assessments on behalf
                  of the Australian government to enable skilled migration. As a
                  member of the Australian Council of Professions and the public
                  voice of the Information and Communications Technology (ICT)
                  profession, ACS is committed to upholding the highest ethical
                  and professional standards in the ICT industry, as well as to
                  ensuring the efficient and beneficial use of ICT for the
                  greater community.
                </p>
                <h2>How To Apply For ACS Skill Assessment?</h2>
                <h3>Understand The Criteria</h3>
                <p>
                  You should know that The Department of Home Affairs in
                  Australia is constantly changing and introducing new
                  regulations, so you must be able to make the necessary
                  adjustments depending on the situation. Before applying for
                  their skill assessment, applicants must stay informed and
                  updated on all current requirements, policies, and home
                  affairs rules. If you do not have a tertiary qualification,
                  you can apply for a PR visa in Australia using the
                  <a href="/acs-rpl-report/">ACS RPL Report</a>.
                </p>
                <h3>Choose Your ANZSCO Code</h3>
                <p>
                  Read your job duties and responsibilities before choosing our
                  ANZSCO code. You won't be able to change your ANZSCO code or
                  remove it so you must be very careful. Your educational
                  qualification and work experience should be related to your
                  ANZSCO code. Also, know that the ACS provides two kinds of
                  Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) applications. The
                  applicant must have a tertiary academic degree and at least
                  six years of experience related to the specialized
                  qualifications specified in the Australian and New Zealand
                  Standard Classification of Occupations (ANZSCO) code for the
                  first application.
                </p>
                <h3>Filling Up The Application Form</h3>
                <p>
                  Fill up the application and submit all the necessary
                  documents. You need to make sure that your documents are in
                  pdf format. The maximum size of the pdf should be 3 mb so do
                  not attach heavy files and compress your documents. Your name
                  in the application should be in the same format as your
                  passport.
                </p>

                <h2>ACS Educational Requirements</h2>
                <h3>Diploma/ Certificates Degree</h3>
                <p>

                  experience should be based on the past 10 years of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, if you have this degree that is not related to your
                  work and is an ICT major then you should have work experience
                  in the past 6 years. Your work experience should be relevant.
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>

                    field, you must show 2 years of relevant work experience in
                    the last 10 years or 4 years of time.

                  <li>

                    related to ICT, you must show proof of at least 5 years of

                <h3>Graduate Degree</h3>
                <p>
                  If your bachelor's degree is at least 50% based on the ICT

                  field. You must also provide a thesis or any graduate project.

                <h2>Why Is ACS Skills Assessment Required?</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>Skill assessment is required for migration purposes.</li>
                  <li>
                    It is to assess the qualification of ICT professionals to

                    It is important to reduce the domestic shortage and to
                    ensure continued economic growth.
                  </li>
                  <li>

                <h2>How Much Time Does ACS Take For Skill Assessment?</h2>
                <p>
                  Once you submit your application it can take up to 12 weeks to
                  get your ACS assessed. You can also get the decision early.
                  Your full skills assessment result is usually valid for three
                  years from the date of issue. Your skills assessment result
                  cannot be renewed once it has expired. You must log into your
                  Dashboard and submit a new skills assessment application
                  through the Online Application Portal. If you want to learn
                  more in detail about how much time does ACS Skill Assessment

                <h2>ACS Skill Assessment Guideline</h2>

                <h2>Skill Assessment Validity</h2>
                <p>
                  Engineers Australia's assessment result will be valid
                  permanently according to Engineers Australia. However, the
                  Engineers Australia Assessment Validity is only valid for
                  three years, according to the Department of Immigration and
                  Border Protection (DIBP). As a result, if the validity date on
                  the skills assessment letter exceeds three years, the
                  Department will disregard the date and stick to the three-year
                  limit.
                </p>

                <h2>Re-apply For Skill Assessment</h2>
                <p>
                  If your application is more than three years old, you must
                  submit a new one. You must contact the Migration Skills
                  Assessment (MSA) and request a new assessment letter to do so.
                  You must also return the original letter with a payment form
                  and pay the full fee once more. You can renew your application
                  online if it is still within the three-year deadline.
