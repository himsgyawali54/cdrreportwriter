                Continuing Professional Development or CPD Engineers Australia
                is prepared to help engineers keep their engineering
                qualifications current and updated. It involves learning, being
                engaged in regular career development activities, and
                professional networking. CPD aims to help engineers improve
                their engineering skills, and maintain their professional
                engineering status.
              </p>
              <h2>CPD Hour Requirements to be Fulfilled</h2>
              <p>
                There are two credit hour requirements that have been based on
                Chartered and NER credentials. You should have 150 hours of
                professional activities maintained every 3 years to keep these
                credentials.
              </p>

              <h2>Quick Guide to writing CPD for Engineer Australia</h2>
              <p>
                Engineer's Australia has outlined the requirements for a CPD
                Report, and how it should be structured:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  It should be provided in a list format (chronological order)
                </li>
                <li>
                  The report should contain details of any formal or informal
                  engineering activity undertaken.
                </li>
                <li>The report must not exceed one page.</li>
                <li>
                  It is not necessary to attach certificates for courses or
                  events participated in.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Note: CPD should also include tasks performed and must include
                certifications too. You can always

              <h2>Engineers Australia CPD</h2>
              <p>
                Engineers Australia offers its members the opportunity to access
                a complete Program of Continuous Professional Development (CPD)
                through their membership. The program includes access to
                tertiary and short courses, a collection of online resources
                such as training, and webinars, as well as a comprehensive
                calendar of events featuring the latest engineering seminars,
                conferences, and technical presentations.
              </p>
              <h3>What is the Engineers Australia CPD Policy?</h3>
              <p>
                Engineers Australia has laid out a Continuing Professional
                Development (CPD) policy for its members. This is also for those
                seeking Chartered status, or those registered with the National
                Engineers Register. It includes that all members who have been
                part of Engineers Australia for at least 5 years must complete
                150 hours of CPD activities in the past year. It also states
                that those who are working part-time or have taken a career
                break in the last 3 years do not need to comply. This policy
                helps engineers to improve their careers and gain knowledge and
                skills.
              </p>
              <h2>CPD Record-Keeping</h2>
              <p>
                Professional Engineers must save documents showing that they
                have completed the Continuing Professional Development (CPD)
                requirements for each year and keep these records for a minimum
                of 5 years. These documents should be accompanied by supporting
                evidence of their activities, such as certificates of completion
                issued by an RTO, TAFE, or an Australian university.
              </p>
              <p>
                They should also include documentation of attendance that has
                the following things mentioned:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Professional Engineer's name</li>
                <li>Title and dates of the course/training</li>
                <li>Duration</li>
                <li>Teacher's name</li>
                <li>Name of the training organisation.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In the case of receiving a request in writing, the engineer must
                provide copies of their CPD records.
              </p>
              <h2>Benefits of CPD</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  CPD increases knowledge and expertise related to the
                  engineering sector.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It improves technical skills along with enhancing academic
                  knowledge.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It provides more job prospects in the engineering field.
                </li>
                <li>Makes you competitive in the job market.</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Engineer Australia CPD Assessments</h2>
              <p>
                After the CPD audit, the CPD auditor must determine whether the
                applicant has fulfilled the CPD requirements satisfactorily or
                not. However, before assessing insufficient submission, the
                auditor must notify the applicant of the proposed assessment,
                including the reasons for it, and allow them at least 10
                business days to comment on it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Engineers Australia will then inform the member of any
                insufficient assessment and provide details of their right to
                request a review of the assessment. This review must be done in
                writing and include enough information to allow it to be
                investigated properly. It should also specify that the CPD
                auditor did not take relevant material into account, took
                irrelevant material, failed to follow due process, or
                demonstrated bias against the member. If the member's chartered
                status or NER registration has been revoked due to the CPD
                audit, they have 90 days to apply for a review.
