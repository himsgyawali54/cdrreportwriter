              <p>
                There could be many factors and reasons why your CDR was
                rejected or could be rejected. Nowadays, the rejection rate is
                very high compared to the previous number as they check each
                component of the Career episodes minutely.
              </p>
              <p>
                Several factors could make an impact on whether your CDR would
                be positively assessed or negatively assessed. Some of them are
                explained in detail below:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Copied content:</strong>You shouldn’t copy the content
                  from anywhere. EA strictly checks about plagiarism, and you
                  can be banned for up to 12 months if copied from anywhere.
                  Plagiarism is unfaithful and gets your CDR rejected. Most of
                  the work is copied from google/website, and some use friends’
                  so there is a high chance of plagiarism.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong
                    >Content on the career episode not as per your
                    Experience/Education:</strong
                  >
                  One of the major reasons for the rejection from EA is the lack
                  of explanation of the specific topic. Instead of describing
                  the project, they give details of the team. It means that you
                  should only focus on your work/report. Most of the time,
                  clients are confused about what to write and what kind of
                  project needs to be selected.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Career episodes are too technical:</strong> Sometimes,
                  the writing can create a problem. They tend to write
                  everything in a very specialized format. Engineers Australia
                  wants details of how you did those engineering activities and
                  how you worked on that project to prove yourself to be an
                  engineer in that field.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Using the first individual:</strong> Specific
                  articulations in your Career Episode are expressly mentioned
                  in the MSA guide. When thinking about group activities or
                  collaboration, you lose focus on your specific job work. ‘I
                  did…’ rather than ‘We did…’ discussion. For example, you may
                  start your sentences by saying “I arranged” or “I planned,”
                  then go on to say “I recorded” or “I set up” or something like
                  that. This is also one of the rejection reasons for the CDR.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong
                    >Too long
                    <a href="../career-episode-engineers-australia/"
                      >Career Episode</a
                    >:</strong
                  >
                  Career Episodes should be between 1,000 and 2,500 words long:
                  As long as you adhere to the specified word limit, don’t
                  forget to include all of EA’s specifics. We recommend you
                  start by reading the EA guidelines and the ANZSCO Code
                  examples, then decide which areas of your professional
                  development will best demonstrate your specialized skills.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong
                    >Unclear
                    <a href="../summary-statement-engineers-australia/"
                      >Summary Statement</a
                    >:</strong
                  >
                  Before you begin writing the CDR report, you should realize
                  that it includes three key components: a Summary Statement,
                  three Career Episodes, and a list of Continuous Professional
                  Development (CPD). Each one plays a crucial function in the
                  CDR report. The summary statement is an important aspect of
                  the CDR since it provides cross-references for all career
                  episodes. The majority of assessors read the first page. It
                  demonstrates how well you process information, which gives
                  people their first impressions of you.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Unusual project selection:</strong> You may face CDR
                  rejection because your supporting project was insufficient.
                  Engineers Australia may reject your proposal if you present it
                  unreasonably. While writing a CDR report, You should choose an
                  appropriate project based on your educational qualifications.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Organizational structure flaws:</strong> The
                  organizational structure should clearly define your hierarchy
                  and position in the project. It is critical to convey your
                  precise position to properly describe the work you have done
                  in your project as viable in the capacity occupied.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong
                    >The CDR suffers from a lack of creative design:</strong
                  >
                  Design activities are given top priority in CDR evaluation.
                  When you include technical design activities in your CDR
                  report, you increase the likelihood of it being positively
                  evaluated. Similarly, a lack of creative design may impede a
                  positive assessment of your CDR report. As a result, explain
                  your technological experience and innovative engineering about
                  your designing activities, and highlight them as much as
                  possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Not mentioning the problematic statements:</strong> In
                  your career episode report, it is critical to note the
                  problems and the steps you took to solve them. Mentioning
                  problem statements in your account clarifies exactly what you
                  contributed and achieved during the project. As a result, make
                  certain that each of your reports contains all the problem
                  statements and solutions.
