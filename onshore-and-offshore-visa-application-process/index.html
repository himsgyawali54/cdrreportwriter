                A Partner Visa is a type of visa for Australia, which allows the
                partner of an Australian citizen or permanent resident to enter,
                stay and work in Australia either temporarily or permanently,
                depending on the visa granted. For the partner to be eligible
                for this visa, they must have a partner who is either a
                permanent resident of Australia, a citizen of Australia, or an
                eligible citizen of New Zealand. There are two types of partner
                visas: Onshore and Offshore Partner visas. These visas can be
                granted as both temporary and permanent visas, allowing the
                holder to live in Australia either for a finite period or
                indefinitely. For more details you can

                consultation.
              </p>
              <h2>What is An Onshore Visa? (subclass 820/801)</h2>
              <p>
                An Onshore Visa (subclass 820/801) is a visa that allows a
                temporary partner who is already in Australia to remain in the
                country while the permanent partner visa (subclass 801) is being
                processed. This visa permits its holder to stay in Australia and
                to be legally employed. It also allows them to travel in and out
                of Australia while the visa is valid. To be eligible for this
                visa, applicants must be sponsored by their Australian partner,
                or by another eligible Australian citizen or permanent resident,
                who has been living in Australia for at least 12 months. The
                sponsor must be aged 18 or over, be an Australian citizen,
                permanent resident, or eligible New Zealand citizen, and must
                provide an Assurance of Support (AoS) for their partner. The
                visa application must include evidence of the applicant's
                relationship with the sponsoring partner, such as shared bank
                accounts and photographs. It is also necessary for the two
                partners to provide health and character documents. Once
                approved, the Onshore Visa (subclass 820/801) will allow the
                applicant to stay in Australia until the decision on their
                permanent partner visa (subclass 801) is made. The visa may also
                be extended if the application is taking longer than expected.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Onshore Visa (subclass 820/801) also allows its holder to
                access certain health care benefits under Medicare. If the visa
                holder is already employed in Australia, they may be able to
                keep their job while the visa is valid. Furthermore, they may be
                able to study at approved institutions while on this visa. This
                visa also enables its holder to apply for Australian citizenship
                after two years of marriage.
              </p>
              <h2>What is An Offshore Visa? (Subclass 309/100)</h2>
              <p>
                An Offshore Visa (Subclass 309/100) is a temporary visa
                available to an eligible partner of an Australian citizen,
                Australian permanent resident or eligible New Zealand citizen.
                This visa allows the holder to live in Australia with their
                partner until a decision is made on their permanent Partner
                (Migrant) visa (subclass 100). The visa also allows the holder
                to work in Australia and travel in and out of the country for
                the duration of the visa. To be eligible for this visa, you must
                be outside Australia when you apply for it and meet certain
                criteria related to your relationship, such as being in a
                genuine ongoing relationship with your partner, who must sponsor
                you. You must also meet health and character requirements. This
                visa can be applied for online. Our
                <a href="../cdr-based-services/">Services</a> may help you
                regarding this process.
              </p>
              <p>
                Applicants must also provide evidence of their relationship in
                the form of documents such as photographs and joint bank
                accounts, birth certificates and other documents to prove their
                financial dependence on each other. If a couple has been married
                for less than two years they may still be eligible, but they
                must provide extra documents to demonstrate the genuineness of
                their relationship.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before any visa is granted, applicants must pass character and
                security checks. These include police certificates from every
                country where the applicant has lived for 12 months or more over
                the past 10 years. The security checks may take some time to
                complete, so it is important to allow for this when applying for
                the visa. The visa can be valid for up to three years before the
                permanent Partner visa application is processed.
              </p>
              <h2>
                What is The Difference Between Onshore and Offshore Visas?
              </h2>
              <p>
                Onshore visas are issued to those wishing to travel to a
                specific country and remain within the boundaries of that
                country during their stay. These types of visas are commonly
                used by those wanting to visit family or friends, conduct
                business, or take a short holiday. The application process for
                onshore visas can vary between countries, but typically requires
                proof of sufficient funds, a valid passport, and other relevant
                documentation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Offshore visas, meanwhile, are generally applied for at a
                foreign embassy or consulate in oneâ€™s home country. These types
                of visas may be used for work purposes, such as studying or
                working abroad, or for other activities such as investment or
                residency. Depending on the country, applicants may be required
                to provide additional documents such as a letter of guarantee
                from a sponsor, financial evidence, and/or a valid passport. In
                some cases, offshore visas may also require personal interviews.
                The application process usually takes longer than for onshore
                visas, and typically involves more stringent requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, offshore visas may be required for visa holders to
                leave the country at some point during their stay; this is not
                always the case with onshore visas. Furthermore, certain
                restrictions may be placed on the activities of visa holders,
                including those related to business, work, or travel. Depending
                on the country, an offshore visa may also provide access to
                preferential services such as banking, insurance, education and
                health care. In some instances, a visa holder may even be
                eligible for citizenship after a certain period of time.
