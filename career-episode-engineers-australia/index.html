              <h2>Career Episode Writing</h2>
              <p>
                One of the most popular services that our clients’ demand is
                writing the career episode for Engineers Australia. This is one
                of the trickiest parts of the skill assessment. Even though the
                MSA booklet has all the needed information, it has failed to
                explain a lot of things, like what kind of project to select and
                what is to be avoided while writing down the career episode. Our
                professional writers, who have done their skill assessment
                themselves along with many years of experience, are easily able
                to understand and identify what is needed. In return, we are
                able to produce top CDR for engineers along with a positive
                assessment from Engineers Australia.
              </p>
              <p>
                Career episodes are actually lengthy documents when we sit down
                to draft them. Each career episode should be in the range of
                2000 to 2500 words, which is technical and personalized. Our
                professional <a href="../">CDR report writers</a> will be in
                constant touch with you, which would be helpful in drafting
                proper career episodes.

          <h2>How to write a career episode in CDR?</h2>
          <p>
            It’s highly essential to understand the importance of the career
            episode for engineers Australia in your CDR report. There are many
            considerations that make a stellar CDR, among which a career episode
            is a significant one. Through the career episode, Engineer Australia
            evaluates your capabilities, knowledge, and competency in the field.
            It basically includes three final projects from your final year, an
            internship, and job-related projects.
          </p>
          <h2>Purpose of career episode</h2>
          <p>
            The career episode represents your skills and knowledge, which act
            as the foundation of the selection procedure. Each and every aspect
            of a career episode for engineers Australia should depict the best
            project handled during your professional life, and distinct points
            should be included in your engineering activity.
          </p>
          <h2>Tips For Writing Career Episode For Engineers Australia</h2>
          <p>
            Thousands of applicants are disqualified every year just because
            they fail to follow the basic guidelines and requirements of
            Engineer Australia. It is one thing that the candidates should not
            ignore and follow every small guideline given.
          </p>
          <h3>1. The style of writing:</h3>
          <p>
            Remember that career episodes for EA are supposed to be written in
            first person and to stick with an active voice. It is to be written
            in English, with a minimum word count of 1500 and a maximum of 2500.
            The applicant should avoid including too many technical terms, and
            it should come off as an essay rather than a tabular form. One thing
            that we should not forget is numbering each paragraph in the career
            episode.
          </p>
          <h3>2. An illustration of engineering knowledge and skills:</h3>
          <p>
            Career episodes should include points about how you used your
            engineering intelligence and skills in handling problems. These
            problem-solving skills will help present your field skills and will
            be evaluated accordingly.
          </p>
          <h3>3. Emphasize on your personal role:</h3>
          <p>
            The company that you are aiming for is hiring you, not your team, so
            it is important to focus on how you will add value to their existing
            world. So, emphasize your personal role.
          </p>
