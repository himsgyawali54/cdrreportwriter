                KA02 is a document required if an applicant is willing to
                migrate to New Zealand as an Engineer or for any Engineering
                field. It helps assess an applicant's skills and is submitted by
                those who do not hold any ICT qualification but are willing to
                migrate and work professionally in the ICT field.
              </p>
              <p>
                To evaluate the knowledge which is necessary to support
                engineering qualifications, applicants should demonstrate their
                commitment to ethical and professional responsibilities.
                Applicants are also required to show their understanding of the
                relevant research in the field. This evaluation consists of five
                sections. The evaluation process provides an opportunity for
                candidates to show their expertise and understanding of the
                engineering field. Applicants should also provide proof of their
                work on the project by submitting all relevant documents,
                emails, or files. This is necessary since IPENZ's competence
                process requires evidence.

          <h2>Eligibility for KA02 Assessment</h2>
          <p>
            Certain eligibility criteria should be followed for the KA02
            Assessment.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If the university from which you are applying is not accredited
              then you must submit the KA02 anyhow.
            </li>
            <li>Having a degree of 4 years if engineering is a must.</li>
            <li>
              Submit a knowledge profile made up of twelve components, including
              context statements and performance indicators.
            </li>
            <li>
              Competency-based evaluation is a must to ensure that the applicant
              has fulfilled every step of the evaluation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Candidates should include engineering-related models, statistics,
              and designs in their projects to demonstrate their competence.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>What are the ways to write a KA02 report?</h2>
          <p>
            There are three steps you need to follow while writing a KA02
            Report. They are:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Knowledge Profile</li>
            <li>Evidence of Application of Knowledge</li>
            <li>Supplementary Evidence</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>1. Knowledge Profile</h3>
          <p>
            You will be evaluated and your engineering capacity will be tested
            here. You must also demonstrate your mathematical understanding of
            the engineering field. You must also summarise key engineering
            fundamentals. Focus on the more progressive elements of work you did
            when describing how your educational program contributed to your
            development.
          </p>
          <h3>2. Evidence of Application of Knowledge</h3>
          <p>
            In this section, you need to show your expertise in engineering,
            which is focused on the theoretical aspect. A detailed overview of
            the project should include the purpose, time, specific duties, and
            your role in the organisation. You must include examples of your
            work such as calculations, reports, or analyses that you have
            personally completed. This will help to verify your engineering
            knowledge, skills, and abilities.
          </p>
          <h3>3. Supplementary Evidence</h3>
          <p>
            In this section, you must present a certified copy of your academic
            transcript that lists your accomplishments in chronological order.
            You should also provide a detailed summary of your work experience
            as well as any other activities that have contributed to your
            advancement in the engineering field. Additional courses, seminars,
            workshops, or any other relevant activities that have helped you
            gain a deeper understanding of your chosen engineering field could
            be included.
          </p>
          <h2>Types of KA02 Knowledge Assessment report</h2>
          <p>
            To be considered for membership, candidates must submit a Knowledge
            Assessment Report that compares their qualifications to the current
            qualifications for professional engineers in New Zealand.
          </p>
          <p>
            A specific type of Knowledge Assessment Report must be submitted to
            the Institution of Professional Engineers New Zealand depending on
            the origin of the candidate's qualification (IPENZ).
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If the candidate obtained their qualification from a Washington
              Accord-accredited university or institution, they must submit a
              KA01 report.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the candidate has graduated from a university or institution
              that is not a member of the Washington Accord or another
              Australian university, they must submit a KA02 report.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Both types of Knowledge Assessment Reports must provide an accurate
            comparison of the candidate's qualifications to New Zealand's
            current qualifications standards for professional engineers.
          </p>
          <h2>Potential Problems That Can be Faced By The Applicants</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Applicants should ensure that they have good language skills as
              the language barrier could be a potential issue.
            </li>
            <li>
              You cannot submit your KA02 report once it has been rejected.
            </li>
            <li>
              IPENZ is very cautious when it comes to reviewing your
              application. Make sure that your report is unique and the
              documents are well organised as small mistakes can lead to
              rejection.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Things to Consider Before Writing a KA02 Report</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Applicants should be able to demonstrate the necessary skills and
              knowledge.
            </li>
            <li>You need to ensure that you have a quality report.</li>
            <li>
              The reports should be free of any plagiarism as the authority can
              find out plagiarised content very easily.
            </li>
            <li>
              To support their achievement, each applicant must detail a few
              tasks they have completed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Applicants should submit their reports on time as there is a time
              limit for submitting the KA02.
            </li>
            <li>
              The report should include calculations, charts, and sections about
              work episodes.
            </li>
            <li>
              If certain files are unavailable, you must prepare them as well
              since the authority can ask for additional documents anytime.
            </li>
          </ul>
